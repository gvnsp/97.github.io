                            Database Management: Created a database using DataGrip and a hospital admission dataset to perform queries for business operations. Utilized SQL to extract and integrate data using different types of joins and performed query performance tuning by creating and modifying indexes and changing query structures. Managed the database and ensured data integrity ( normalization, entity integrity, referential integrity, and domain integrity) by building relational schemas and ERD diagrams based on business requirements in Access, ERDPlus, and Datagrip and performing CRUD operations.

As to increase revenue for the organization through a financial perspective by accepting newer methods of payments from payers and thus pooling new admissions who prefer to pay through routes to increase the net revenue. For instance, If the hospital doesn’t accept out-of-network patients because of the discrepancies in payment methods from payers (Not all insurance plans cover PPO payments). Through this initiative, the hospital will adapt to accept newer patients and services who choose to pay through PPOs. And, through systematic customer service and increased patient satisfaction, the rate of admissions goal would be me, thus increasing the net revenue. The goal of this initiative is to generate annual revenue of $ 3,266,667.

                        <p>
                         Applied root cause analysis techniques to address the issue of missed and delayed diagnosis of sepsis. The analysis involved a comprehensive evaluation of the underlying factors contributing to the problem, including a review of medical records, interviews with healthcare providers, and analysis of relevant data and systems. The findings from the root cause analysis led to recommendations for improved processes, increased education for healthcare providers and implementation of technology solutions to enhance the early detection and rapid response to sepsis.                        </p>

                                   Conducted data-driven analysis and provided actionable recommendations for healthcare improvement. By utilizing large datasets and advanced analytics techniques, I identified key areas for improvement within the healthcare system and developed a series of SMART format recommendations to address these issues. These recommendations were grounded in evidence-based practices and were designed to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

                        <h3> A3 approach to reduce wait times</h3>
                        <p>
                                   Utilized an A3 format template to reduce patient wait times within a healthcare system. The template was used to analyze the existing process and identify opportunities for improvement. I then applied Sequencing Rules such as First come, first served (FCFS), Shortest processing time (SPT), Earliest due date (EDD), Slack time remaining (STR), and Critical ratio (CR) to develop a prioritization system for patient processing. This innovative solution was implemented and resulted in a significant reduction in patient wait times, improved patient satisfaction, and increased efficiency in the healthcare system.
